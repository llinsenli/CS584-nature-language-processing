1. All python file contain knn.py, run.py, sgd.py, utils.py, word2vec.py
2. The npy file and pickle file are the training result. The npy file
   is the result of the word vector. In knn.py, I use saved_params_40000.npy
   to read in the data and test the result.
3. I also add knn test in run.py, which use the training result directly. So
   I have two parts of knn test.
4. The example package conatins all vector.png file I generate in the process.
