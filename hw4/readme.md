1. The coding part are in three py files and a ipynb file:
    q1.py contains the whole process for task 1
    q2.py contains the whole process for task 2
    q2_improve.py is not required for homework, it is an improvement for the model in task 2

    hw4.ipynb contains all process for this homework. I include it because the ipynb file is more readable
    and easier to show the intermediate result.

2. The report part is all in the Report_for_hw4.pdf file

3. The model.h5 and model.json file are the model I train in q2_improve.py file.
   In q2_improve.py file I just load the saved model to show the result.

4. The glove.6B.100d.txt file is the for pre-train in q2_improve.py.
